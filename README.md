# SLIC Algorithm for Superpixel Segmentation

This repository contains an implementation of the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm for superpixel segmentation using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. Superpixel segmentation is a computer vision technique that groups similar pixels together to form meaningful regions in an image.

## Overview

- **SLIC Algorithm:** The code implements the SLIC algorithm, a popular method for generating superpixels in images.

- **Dependencies:** The implementation relies on OpenCV and NumPy for image processing and numerical operations.

## Usage

- **Open**  the Jupyter notebook or Python script in your preferred environment.
- **Customize** the image_path, k, and m parameters in the main function for your use case.
- **Execute** the script to see the SLIC algorithm in action on your images.
